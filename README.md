JavaScript Projects

Project 1- Write a program that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius The centigrade to Fahrenheit conversion formula is: C = (5/9) x (F -32) Where F is the Fahrenheit temperature. The Fahrenheit formula is F = C x 9 / 5 + 32

Pseudo Code Set variables Prompt user to enter temperature in either Fah or Celsius depending on which way they are converting (separate boxes to specify) Use conversion equation to convert and display answer

Project 2 – • Write a function that takes in a list of stock at a shop. It will ask the customer what they’re looking for, and if it’s in stock then it will return “[your item] is currently in stock”. If the item is not in stock then it will return “[your item] is not in stock.” And will ask the customer if they want to order the item. If yes, then the item will get added to stock list. Print out the new list to check. If no, then the program will terminate with a message.

Pseudo Code Create a list of all the stock available Ask the user what they are looking for If the item is in stock(is in the list) Print “[your item] is currently in stock” If the item is not in stock Print “Sorry, [your item] is not in stock, would you like to order this in?” If yes add the item to the list and print the new list of stock If no terminate and print “Ok, thanks for visiting”

Project 3 – contact form On your contact form page, create a contact form if you haven’t done so already using HTML and CSS and add in some Cyber Security parameters to each field. Criteria: • Create an external JavaScript file and link to your HTML page. • For each field the characters must be between x and y in length. • Use CSS to style it and add design • For an extra challenge try to prevent special characters from being included in your form and set other criteria – this is not essential.

Pseudo Code Create CSS form Set variables for name, email, phone, comment and error Create conditions for each Name – must be greater than 8 characters and less than 40 Email - must be greater than 8 characters and less than 40 Phone – must be greater than 11 and less than 12 numbers (in case people but a space after the first 5 characters) Comment - must be greater than 10 characters and less than 500 If all of the conditions are met, submit the form and print Thankyou message on a new page If conditions are not met error message explaining what is incorrect pops up in box
